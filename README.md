Issues Scrapper is a Python3-based application that collects and organizes good first issues from GitHub repositories.
This tool uses web scraping and database management to collect project information, including name, programming
language, tags, descriptions, stars, open and resolved issues, labels, and forks, into a consolidated MongoDB database
hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

But this tool does not end there. The REST API built among FastAPI allows developers to easily access information on
beginner-friendly projects, and the database is automatically updated every 12 hours to ensure the most up-to-date
content.

This platform connects novice and experienced developers to a wide range of open-source possibilities.
